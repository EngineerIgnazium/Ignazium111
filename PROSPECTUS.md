# CodeFund Advertising 2019 Q1 Prospectus

## Overview

CodeFund is an ethical advertising platform that focuses on funding open source development. Up to 65% of all gross revenue is given back to the developer community.

We believe that by providing an effective marketing channel for companies to share their products and services, developers can capitalize on ad revenue without needing to have their visitors tracked and profiled.

We have over 10 million monthly pageviews and are growing at approx 20% per month. Our primary audience is JavaScript developers, but we have been expanding into additional programming languages such as Ruby, Python, Java, C++, PHP and Go.

Our platform follows the "ethical advertising" guidelines that ReadTheDocs established. We will not track or profile the ad viewers, and we only show ads that are relevant to the audience. This document describes how we can help you reach a broader audience. We look forward to working with you!

## Targeting

We offer targeting based on programming language and geographic segmentation. We
do not provide third party tracking or remote scripting support.

### Language / Topic Segmentation

Every publisher website that we place ads on typically relates to a specific programming
language or topic. This allows us to target each ad impression to a programming language or
topic that the visitor is interested in. This is our primary method of targeting visitors.

#### Programming Languages and Topics

Our targeting options include, but are not limited to:

* JavaScript
* Ruby
* PHP
* Python
* C, C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Visual Basic
* Java
* DevOps
* Mobile Development (ioS / Android)
* Elixir / Erlang
* Go
* Blockchain

### Geographic Segmentation

We also support geo-targeting to the country level. This allows you to target your
messages to specific countries of interest, or exclude a set of countries that aren't
relevant to your ads.

## UTM Params

Each campaign can be configured to redirect to whichever URL you specify. This can include
UTM parameters. We do automatically place a `utm_referrer` on the redirect URL that includes the referring URL of the property the ad appeared on. This will help you know which publishers are performing the best and which are not.

## Reported Statistics

We track statistics on our own platform, and report them to you at via the advertiser
dashboard.

We do not track, nor provide, any identifiable information for ad viewers.

## Limitations

We believe that a major issue with the advertising industry is the tracking of users with
third-party scripts.

**To address this, we don't allow any third-party scripts to be run in
our ad placements.**

## Ad Creatives

Our publishers have the option of selecting from numerous ad templates to use on their properties.

Each template uses an ad creative that follows these guidelines:

* Ad creative **headline** + **body** should not be more than **84 characters long**.
* Banner image may not be animated.
* We recommend the use of ðŸ‘‹ emoji when it makes sense, but don't overuse it.

We are software developers first and foremost. We will help you craft a message that resonates with the developer community if needed.
